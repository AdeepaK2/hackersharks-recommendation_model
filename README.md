# Recommendation Model for Personalized Travel Destinations

## Overview
This model was built to recommend personalized travel destinations for tourists visiting Sri Lanka. Based on visitor preferences such as preferred activities and bucket-list destinations, the model provides top 5 destination recommendations. This ensures tourists receive suggestions that align with their interests and provide a diverse range of high-quality experiences.

## Model Selection Rationale
I chose this model based on its ability to:

### 1. Relevance
The model aligns the tourist's preferences (activities and destinations) with the available data on places in Sri Lanka. By prioritizing activities and matching them to destinations, the model ensures a high degree of relevance in recommendations.

### 2. Diversity
The recommendations also ensure variety, offering a balance between well-known and lesser-known destinations. This provides tourists with options that cater to different aspects of their preferences while allowing for exploration of new locations.

### 3. Data Quality Consideration
Places with higher ratings and user feedback are given priority, ensuring that the recommendations not only match preferences but also reflect quality destinations that have been positively reviewed by others.
