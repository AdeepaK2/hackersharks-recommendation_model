Data Analysis Project
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis process, including data preprocessing, data enrichment, and extracting insights to provide valuable recommendations. Below is an overview of the different stages and approaches used in this analysis.

1. Approaches Used for Data Analysis
Employed libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and ast for data manipulation and analysis.
Utilized TfidfVectorizer for text-based analysis and cosine_similarity for determining similarity between user preferences and potential recommendations.
Handled geographical data using latitude and longitude for location-based recommendations.
2. Insights Derived from the Analysis
Analyzed user data to understand preferred activities and bucket-list destinations.
Evaluated and processed reviews for various destinations to derive key insights.
Used data-driven techniques to identify the most suitable destinations based on users' preferences and recent reviews.
3. Data Enrichment Process
Enhanced the datasets by incorporating additional columns such as user ratings and reviews.
Included location-based data (latitude, longitude) to facilitate geographical filtering and recommendations.
Applied literal_eval for safe conversion of string-represented lists into Python lists for further processing.
4. Data Preprocessing Methods
Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately, ensuring data quality and consistency.
Implemented functions to safely evaluate and convert data into usable formats.
Utilized feature scaling and label encoding to prepare data for model evaluation and similarity calculations.
5. Evaluation Metrics
Applied evaluation metrics such as cosine similarity to match user preferences with the most relevant destinations.
Considered user ratings and total review counts to prioritize highly-rated destinations for recommendations.
